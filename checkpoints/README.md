## ? Pretrained Checkpoints

We provide pretrained model checkpoints for reproducibility and convenient evaluation.  
All checkpoints are hosted on **Baidu Netdisk**:

- **URL**: <https://pan.baidu.com/s/1yho_6gdZkiaquWn-mPOeEw?pwd=u2zf>

The shared folder contains two subdirectories:
- **Synapse/**: best-performing checkpoint trained on the Synapse dataset
- **AVT/**: best-performing checkpoint trained on the AVT dataset
- swin_tiny_patch4_window7_224.pth (Swin Transformer backbone weights)

Each subdirectory stores the corresponding **optimal model weights** used for the reported results.
